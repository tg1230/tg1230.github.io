## Lead Developer for CELL Research Project
I worked in the Letters and Science IT department at UC Davis for a little under 2 years and have been working on a research project as the lead developer for around a year now. Throughout my time in IT, I had the opportunity of working alongside an amazing supervisor who really helped me to develop my interpersonal and problem-solving skills. When I started working on the research project as a junior, I saw a great opportunity to work on a project long term and work on a really interesting game. Around 6 months in, the original project lead graduated and I was recommended, interviewed, and hired. This was the start of a really fascinating journey on this project while in the middle of a pandemic which I go plan on going into more depth in another post. Needless to say, I continue to develop skills in communication and programming and Iâ€™m really excited to be starting my career in software development!
